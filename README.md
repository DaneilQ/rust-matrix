# Rust Matrix

A very simple implementation of the matrix effect in Rust with Raylib.

## Do whatever you want with it

I'm just reading the book and this seemed like a fun project to fuck around with Rust.

### Ver 1.2

This used to be a simple main.rs file, but I had to make a few changes to re-use pieces of code in future small projects without too much hassle.

1. Separated core raylib functionality from matrix effect/game logic.
3. Separated "motion blur" effect from core and game logic, maybe I overthought it and might not be the best implementation though.
2. Added constants for quick editing to window size, name, fps, and such.

I know too little about game development file structure, so I'm probably going to keep updating it on future Rust w/ Raylib projects, however I dunno if i'll keep updating this one.
